# EncryptSharp
EncryptSharp is a simple encryption program that a friend and I made. It doesn't work with non- alphanumeric characters.
It was mostly an experiment, and we might fix the character issue eventually. The basic function involves taking a string of any length of alphanumeric characters and encrypting it by changing it to a different ASCII value and the decrypting it by changing it back.
Content Warning: Due to the functionality of this program relying upon ASCII values, we do not support non-ASCII characters. We apologize to those who may be offended by these omissions. These omissions do not reflect Fapsoft's values, and should be viewed as a strictly technological limitation, and not any sort of discrimination against non English speaking cultures.
