# EncryptSharp
EncryptSharp is a simple encryption program that a friend and I made. It doesn't work with non- alphanumeric characters.
It was mostly an experiment, and we might fix the character issue eventually. The basic function involves taking a string of any length of alphanumeric characters and encrypting it by changing it to a different ASCII value and the decrypting it by changing it back.
BREAKING: As per recent news released by CNN, Russia has gotten a hold of our encryption process as well and thus we highly recommend that any users utilizing our program to protect sensitive information such as passwords, bank account numbers, SSN's, etc., switch to a different encryption process.
